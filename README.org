This package provides a list of commands to be able to fetch, add, modify and
remove events to Apple's Calendar app.

* About This Fork
** Purpose of Fork
The purpose of [[https://github.com/FrederickGeek8/][my]] personal fork is to add some org-mode/agenda functionality to the [[https://github.com/haji-ali/maccalfw][original maccalfw project]]. /I/ deemed this functionality to be out-of-scope of the original project, although someone could pull in my changes in the future if they wanted to.

*Do not rely on this fork.* I am not planning on maintaining it for anyone except for myself. I am not trying to replace the original project. Forking it was just easier for me.

** Additional Setup
If you use Doom Emacs (like I) a basic configuration can look like:
In =config.el=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! maccalfw-org
  :after org
  :config
  ;; Here I use advice because (org-agenda-files) is a function.
  ;; If you have a static org-agenda-files variable, you could add maccalfw-org-output-file to it.
  (advice-add 'org-agenda-files :filter-return (lambda (orig) (maccalfw-org-write-file) (push (expand-file-name maccalfw-org-output-file) orig)))

  ;; These custom variables can also be set in :config
  :custom
  ;; Specify the default calendars to fetch
  (maccalfw-org-default-calendars '("Calendar 1" "Household Events"))
  ;; Specify the location to write the org-file to
  (maccalfw-org-output-file (expand-file-name ".hidden/calendar.org" org-directory))
  )
#+end_src

If you haven't already, set up your =packages.el= to point to my fork -- adding =maccalfw-org.el= to your ~:files~ list, if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! maccalfw :recipe
  (
   :host github
   :repo "FrederickGeek8/org-maccalfw"
                   :files ("maccalfw.el" "maccalfw-org.el" ("src" . "src"))))
#+end_src

* Installation
=maccalfw= can be installed with the following =use-package= command, assuming
that you have straight installed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package maccalfw
    :commands maccalfw-open
    :straight (:host github
                     :repo "haji-ali/maccalfw"
                     :files ("maccalfw.el" ("src" . "src"))))
#+end_src

You will need to have the Swift compiler (=swiftc=) which is needed to compile
the internal module.

Emacs must also have access to your Apple Calendars which means that you will
need to add the following to Emacs' =Info.plist= (for example inside
=/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Info.plist=) somewhere inside the outer
=<dict>= tag

#+begin_src xml
  <key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Emacs requires permission to access the calendar for maccalfw.el to work.</string>
#+end_src

and restart Emacs so that when =maccalfw= requests access you will be shown a
permission dialog that you can approve.

* Configuration
There's no further configuration needed. You can call =maccalfw-open= to open
a =week= view of the calendar using =calfw=.

This is how my calendar looks vs my Apple's calendar.

If you want to recreate a similar parity with Apple's calendar then you may
want to use my fork [[https://github.com/haji-ali/calfw-blocks][calfw-blocks]].
